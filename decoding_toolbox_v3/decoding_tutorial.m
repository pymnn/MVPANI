% This script is an example on how to perform a searchlight decoding
% analysis on brain image data. It is combined with a tutorial.
%
% Every decoding analysis needs a cfg structure as input. This structure 
% contains all information necessary to perform a decoding analysis. All
% values that you don't set are automatically assigned using the function
% 'decoding_defaults' (for a list of all possible parameters, see
% decoding.m and decoding_defaults.m).
%
% If you want to know the defaults now, enter:
%   cfg = decoding_defaults;
% and now look at the cfg structure, you will see a lot of entries that have
% been set automatically. You can change each of these manually. They are
% all explained in the functions decoding.m and decoding_defaults.m.

%% First, set the defaults and define the analysis you want to perform

% Add path to this toolbox
% If this function is in same path as the toolbox, simply comment the line
% (then the path will be set automatically).
% addpath($ADD PATH AS STRING$)

% Clear cfg (otherwise if you re-run this script, previous parameters may still be present)
clear cfg

% To set the path, run
decoding_defaults; % use cfg = decoding_defaults to set the defaults, too

% Enter which analysis method you like
% The standard decoding method is searchlight, but we should still enter 
% it to be on the safe side.
cfg.analysis = 'searchlight';

% Specify where the results should be saved, e.g. 'c:\exp\results\buttonpress'
cfg.results.dir = FILLTHISOUT;

%% Second, get the file names, labels and run number of each brain image
%% file to use for decoding.

% For example, you might have 6 runs and two categories. That should give 
% you 12 images, one per run and category. Each image has an associated 
% filename, run number and label (= category). With that information, you
% can for example do a leave-one-run-out cross validation.

% There are two ways to get the information we need, depending on what you 
% have done previously. The first way is easier.

% === Automatic Preparation === 
% a) If you generated all parameter estimates (beta images) in SPM and were 
% using only one model for all runs (i.e. have only one SPM.mat file), use
% the following block. If not, go to "Manual Preparation".

% Specify the directory to your SPM.mat and all related beta images,
% e.g. 'c:\exp\glm\model_buttonpress'
beta_dir = FILLTHISOUT;
% Specify the label names that you gave your regressors of interest in the 
% SPM analysis (e.g. 'button left' and 'button right'). If you don't
% remember, then run:
% display_regressor_names(beta_dir)
% You may also use the wildcard * (but use with care!). Label names are
% case sensitive!
labelname1 = FILLTHISOUT;
labelname2 = FILLTHISOUT;

% Also set the path to the brain mask(s) (e.g.  created by SPM: mask.img). 
% Alternatively, you can specify (multiple) ROI masks as a cell or string 
% matrix).
% for searchlight or wholebrain e.g. 'c:\exp\glm\model_button\mask.img' OR 
% for ROI e.g. {'c:\exp\roi\roimaskleft.img', 'c:\exp\roi\roimaskright.img'}
cfg.files.mask = FILLTHISOUT;

% The following function extracts all beta names and corresponding run
% numbers from the SPM.mat. The function appends ' bin 1' to ' bin m' to
% the beta names if multiple regressors have been used for each condition 
% within a run, e.g. when using time derivatives or an FIR design.
regressor_names = design_from_spm(beta_dir);

% Now with the names of the labels, we can extract the filenames and the 
% run numbers of each label. The labels will be 1 and -1.
% Important: You have to make sure to get the label names correct and that
% they have been uniquely assigned, so please check them in regressor_names
% or with decoding_plot_regressor_names(beta_dir)
cfg = decoding_describe_data(cfg,{labelname1 labelname2},[1 -1],regressor_names,beta_dir);
%
% Other examples:
% For a cross classification, it would look something like this:
% cfg = decoding_describe_data(cfg,{labelname1classA labelname1classB labelname2classA labelname2classB},[1 -1 1 -1],regressor_names,beta_dir,[1 1 2 2]);
%
% Or for SVR with a linear relationship like this:
% cfg = decoding_describe_data(cfg,{labelname1 labelname2 labelname3 labelname4},[-1.5 -0.5 0.5 1.5],regressor_names,beta_dir);

% === Manual Preparation ===
% If you have used "Automatic Preparation", you can skip this step.
% Alternatively to the automatic extraction of relevant information for 
% your decoding, you can also manually prepare the "files" field.
% For this, you have to load all image names and labels you want to use 
% separately, e.g. with spm_select. This is not part of this example, but 
% if you do it later, you should end up with the following fields:
% зЂвт  cfg.files.name: a 1xn cell array of file names
%   cfg.files.chunk: a nx1 vector to indicate what data you want to keep 
%       together for cross-validation (typically runs, so enter run numbers)
%   cfg.files.label: a nx1 vector of labels (for decoding, you can choose 
%       any two numbers as class labels, but normally we use 1 and -1)

%% Third, create your design for the decoding analysis

% зЂвт In a design, there are several matrices, one for training, one for test,
% and one for the labels that are used (there is also a set vector which we
% don't need right now). In each matrix, a column represents one decoding 
% step (i.e. train-test-cycle, e.g. cross-validation run) while a row 
% represents one sample (i.e. brain image). The decoding analysis will 
% later iterate over the columns (i.e. "steps") of this design matrix. For 
% example, you might start off with training on the first 5 runs and 
% leaving out the 6th run. Then the columns of the design matrix will 
% look as follows (we also add the run numbers and file names to make it 
% clearer):
% cfg.design.train cfg.design.test cfg.design.label cfg.files.chunk cfg.files.name
%        1                0              -1               1         ..\beta_0001.img
%        1                0               1               1         ..\beta_0002.img
%        1                0              -1               2         ..\beta_0009.img 
%        1                0               1               2         ..\beta_0010.img 
%        1                0              -1               3         ..\beta_0017.img 
%        1                0               1               3         ..\beta_0018.img 
%        1                0              -1               4         ..\beta_0025.img 
%        1                0               1               4         ..\beta_0026.img 
%        1                0              -1               5         ..\beta_0033.img 
%        1                0               1               5         ..\beta_0034.img 
%        0                1              -1               6         ..\beta_0041.img 
%        0                1               1               6         ..\beta_0042.img 

% Again, a design can be created automatically (with a design function) or
% manually. If you use a design more often, then it makes sense to create
% your own design function.
%
% If you are a bit confused what the three matrices mean (train, test & label), 
% have a look at them in cfg.design after you executed the next step.
% This should make it easier to understand.

% === Automatic Creation ===
% This creates the leave-one-run-out cross validation design:
cfg.design = make_design_cv(cfg);

% === Automatic Creation - alternative ===
% Alternatively, you can create the design during runtime of the decoding 
% function, by specifying the following parameter:
% cfg.design.function.name = 'make_design_cv';
% For the current example this is not helpful, because you can already
% create the design at this point. However, you might run into cases in 
% which you cannot prespecify the design (e.g. if your design depends on 
% the outcome of some previous runs), and then this function will become
% useful.

% === Manual Creation ===
% After having explained the structure of the design file above, it should
% be easy to create the structure yourself. You can then check it by visual
% inspection. Dependencies between training and test set will be checked
% automatically in the main function.

% Another remark: Check out combine_designs.m if you like to combine 
% multiple designs in one cfg.

%% Fourth, set additional parameters manually

% This is an optional step. For example, you want to set the searchlight 
% radius and you have non-isotropic voxels (e.g. 3x3x3.75mm), but want the
% searchlight to be spherical in real space.

% Searchlight-specific parameters
cfg.searchlight.unit = 'mm'; % comment or set to 'voxels' if you want normal voxels
cfg.searchlight.radius = 12; % this will yield a searchlight radius of 12 units (here: mm).
cfg.searchlight.spherical = 0;

% Other parameters of interest:
% The verbose level allows you to determine how much output you want to see
% on the console while the program is running (0: no output, 1: normal 
% output [default], 2: high output).
cfg.verbose = 1;

% Choose the method you want to perform (classification or regression). If
% your classifier supports the kernel method (currently only libsvm), then
% you can also choose classification_kernel (our default).
cfg.decoding.method = 'classification_kernel'; % this is our default anyway.
% cfg.decoding.method = 'classification'; % this is slower, but sometimes necessary
% cfg.decoding.method = 'regression'; % choose this for regression

% Define which measures/transformations you like to get as ouput
% You have the option to get different measures of the decoding. For
% example, you can get the accuracy for each voxel, the accuracy minus
% chance, sensitivity and specifitiy values, AUC, and quite some more.
% For a full list, see "help decoding_transform_results", the transres_*
% functions in transform_results, or checkout how you can add your own
% measure/transformation in README.txt (or copy one of the transres_*
% functions).

cfg.results.output = 'accuracy_minus_chance';
% This value is already the default, i.e. you could remove it if you only
%живЊ want this value. % For a regression analysis, you would like to 'corr' or
% better 'zcorr'. For multiple outputs, use cell arrays, e.g.
% cfg.results.output = {'accuracy_minus_chance', 'AUC_minus_chance'};
% For more options, again check "help decoding_transform_results" or look
% at the transres_* functions in the transform_results folder.

% parameters for libsvm (linear SV classification, cost = 1, no screen output)
% cfg.decoding.train.classification.model_parameters = '-s 0 -t 0 -c 1 -b 0 -q'; 
% живЊ parameters for libsvm (linear SV regression, cost = 1, no screen output)
% cfg.decoding.train.classification.model_parameters = '-s 4 -t 0 -c 1 -b 0 -q'; 

%% Not necessary, but nice: Decide what you want to plot

% It's really fascinating and informative to look at how a searchlight 
% (or your ROIs/etc.) look like. However, 3d plotting is very slow.
% Thus, you have different options to look at your searchlight:
%   0: Don't draw it at all (default)
%   1: Draw the searchlight/ROI/... every step
%   2: Every second step
%    ...
% 100: Every 100th step
% You got it. 
% Just try different values and observe the running time you get.

cfg.plot_selected_voxels = 500;

% Or switch online plotting off completely:
%   cfg.plot_selected_voxels = 0;

cfg.plot_design = 1; % this is by default set to 1, but if you repeat the same design again and again, it can get annoying...

% The following calls allow you to look at your design. The design will
% also be shown when you perform the decoding.

% If you want to display the design in textform in the Matlab window
display_design(cfg);
% Display the design as a plot (will be done later anyway, so it can stay deactivated)
% plot_design(cfg);

%% Fifth, run the decoding analysis

% Fingers crossed it will not generate any error messages ;)
results = decoding(cfg);

% This will generate some results that are written, some of which are used
% only for sanity checks:
% (a) your decoding results as res_XX.nii or res_XX.img files
% (b) a res_XX.mat file containing all information in the images and more
% (c) a cfg.mat file containing the settings
% (d) the decoding design as an image in multiple formats
% (e) res_filedetails.txt and res_warnings.mat as sanity checks
%
% If your output contains more than one value per voxel, then (a) is not
% written. If you did a ROI or wholebrain analysis and want to extract the
% exact numerical results, you can do so by loading the result from (b)
% and navigating to the field results.accuracy_minus_chance.output or
% whatever your output is. For searchlight analyses the voxel locations are
% currently only provided as indices.

%% Sixth, inspect the results visually or do statistics
%живЊ Visual inspection of searchlight results can be done e.g. using software
% such as MRIcron: Open a background image, select your decoding results
% (typically res_accuracy_minus_chance.img) as overlay and set the range
% between 5 and e.g. 20. Increase the lower value until you can see blobs
% that may look meaningful. These regions may contain information. For
% statistical analysis at the group-level, normalize and smooth your images
% if not done previously and run a classical second-level t-test against 0
% 
% ROI or wholebrain analysis:
% See right below "results = decoding(cfg);" for visual inspection. For
% statistical analysis at the group-level, extract all decoding results and
% do a t-test either with Matlab, SPSS or the software of your choice.
%
% For subject-level statistics, run help decoding_statistics.
%% Some more hints for potentially useful features

% живЊ All of these need to be specified BEFORE calling decoding(cfg), of
% course.

% cfg.searchlight.subset = [5, 100, 1000, 1001]'; 
%   only decode some searchlights are executed. This makes sense if you
%   have coordinates and want results at these searchlight ROIs only. It
%   can also be used to parallelize the toolbox, i.e. running the first
%   10000 searchlights on one computer, the second on another, etc. Takes
%   either single values or 3d coordinates.
% (call "help decoding" and search for "subset" for more infos)
