# MVPANI
MVPANI: A Toolkit With Friendly Graphical User Interface for Multivariate Pattern Analysis of Neuroimaging Data

# Environmental Requirements

(1) Runs under Windows Operating System (Windows 7 and above).

(2) Runs under MATLAB 2015b and above.

(3) The [SPM package](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) needs to be installed in MATLAB.

# Getting started
Once MVPANI has been downloaded to your computer, use SetPath in MATLAB to add the entire MVPANIV1.0 folder to the path list as follows:

(1) Unzip MVPANIV to a directory on your disk, assuming the directory is: `F:\MVPA\MVPANI_V1.0` after unzipping;

(2) Open MATLAB, `HOME` â†’ `SetPath`;

(3) Click `Add with Subfolders` and select the MVPANIV1.0 folder (i.e. `F:\MVPA\MVPANI_V1.0`);

(4) Click `Save`.

(5) Enter `MVPANI` in the MATLAB Command Window to launch the main interface of MVPANI
